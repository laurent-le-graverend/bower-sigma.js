bower-sigma.js
==============

This repo is for distribution on `bower`. The source for this module is in the
[main Sigma.js repo](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/).

I configure the build for my needs, use at your own risks!
If you need this, you have better to clone it and change the sources you need
in the `bower.json` file.
